## Features
- Any bitmap size
- Supports doors, secret passages, special sectors, entrances, exits,  variable floor/ceiling heights
- Theme configuration to create maps with various feelings and textures (hell, tech base, sewers...)
- Can generate maps in the Doom 1 (ExMx) or Doom 2 (MAPxx) name format
- Optional things generation to create immediately playable maps filled with monsters and items. Or you can disable the thing generator and populate the map yourself using a map editor such as [DoomBuilder](http://www.doombuilder.com/)
- Includes [Bsp](http://games.moria.org.uk/doom/bsp/) for node generation on Windows. On macOS/Linux you'll have to build nodes manually using a third-party node builder before you can play your maps



## Usage

### Using the command-line
Syntax is: **PNG2WAD.exe SomeImage.png \[SomeOtherImage.png\] \[YetAnotherImage.png\]...**

### From the GUI
Drag and drop one or more PNG files on **PNG2WAD.exe**

### Output

Output file will always be generated in the directory where PNG2WAD.exe is located and will have a the name of the first PNG file with a wad extension. For instance, if you create a file from SomePlace.png, SomeOtherPlace.png and AThirdPlace.png, the output file will be named SomePlace.wad.

If Doom 1 format has been selected in Preferences.ini, first map will be named ExM1, then ExM2, etc (Where x is the number of the episode as defined in Preferences.ini). Maps beyond ExM9 will be ignored.

If Doom 2 format has been selected in Preferences.ini, first map will be named MAP01, then MAP02, MAP03, etc. Maps beyond MAP99 will be ignored.

Default format is **Doom 2**.

## Creating images

Run your favorite image edition tool and create a new PNG of any size. Each pixel is a 64x64 tile on the map.

### Theme
The upper-left pixel is always a wall. Its color is ignored and used to select the map theme, as defined in the Preferences.ini file. You can add more themes by editing the file.

Available themes are:

- Gray (128, 128, 128): cave
- Red (255, 0, 0): hell
- Steel blue (128, 128, 255) : city
- Any other color: tech base (default)
